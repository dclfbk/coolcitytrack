## Fragility
According to the study 'La fragilità demografica, sociale ed economica nelle aree statistiche del comune di Bologna' (2022),  analysis of fragility is divided into three areas: demographic, social and economic. Several indicators are used to calculate each of them, namely:
- Indicators for situations of potential **demographic fragility**:
  - percentage change in resident population from 1/1/2017 to 12/31/2021
  - average annual natural balance over the five-year period 2017 - 2021
  - percentage of resident population aged 80 and over as of 12/31/2021
    
- Indicators for situations of potential **social fragility**:
  - Percentage of the population aged 65 and over living alone as of 12/31/2021
  - Exchange of the Italian population between 20 and 64 years old (immigrants + emigrants related to the average population in the
five-year period 2017 - 2021)
  - Foreign population change between 20 and 64 years old (immigrants + emigrants related to the average population in the
five-year period 2017 - 2021)
  - Percentage of the foreign resident population aged 0-19 years out of the total population aged 0-19 years
as of 12/31/2021
  - Percentage of children in single-parent (non-cohabiting) households out of total children as of 12/31/2021
  - Percentage of college graduates aged 25-44 out of total population aged 25-44 as ofCensus 2011
  - Percentage of elderly in high or very high health fragility status over total elderly as of 31/12/2021
  - Composite indicator of Low Territorial Integration as of 31/12/2021
  - Percentage of households with insufficient living space as of 31/12/2021
  - BIL (composite indicator of Low Labor Intensity) as of 31/12/2021
  - BQE (Composite Inidcator of Low Housing Quaity) as of 31/12/2021

- Indicators for situations of potential **economic fragility**:
  - Percentage of renter-occupied dwellings at the 2011 Census
  - Median per capita equivalent income of resident households - Fiscal year 2020
  - Percentage of households with a 2020 median per capita equivalent income of less than €12,853 (equal to 60% of the median)

With the intention of bringing attention to the current climate situation, a fourth indicator could be added to those previously defined: indicators for situations of potential **climatic fragility**:
- Percentage of heat island
- Number of green nature-based solutions (such as public parks,  urban forests, street trees ... )
- Number of blue nature-based solutions (ponds, lakes, rivers...)
- Climate shelters score (if any)


The new indicator of **potential fragility** will be calculated as a weighted average of the four scope indicators (demographic, social, economic, climatic), giving greater weight to the social scope.
