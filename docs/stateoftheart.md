- *Abstract*: Climate shelters are critical urban infrastructures to support adaptation to extreme weather. They offer spaces – e.g., parks, libraries, and civic centers – where residents can take refuge during episodes of extreme temperatures. With over 200 public spaces designated as “Climate Shelters”, Barcelona (Spain) serves as an emblematic example of whether these emerging spaces are meeting the needs, expectations, and everyday experiences of the most vulnerable residents. By applying an intersectional climate justice perspective and mixed-method approaches rooted in a survey of a particularly climate-exposed working-class neighborhood (La Prosperitat), we found that the intersecting vulnerabilities of marginalized populations remain poorly addressed, largely due to differences in access to coping mechanisms that overlap with intersecting social positions, exacerbating vulnerability to climate risks. We also found that housing inadequacy and energy poverty experienced by low income residents and those originally from Global South countries made them the most affected and least able to cope with extreme temperatures. Women were also more affected by climate impacts and more concerned about current and future risks. We argue that unequal lived experiences of thermal (dis)comforts inform heat and cold inequalities, which, in turn, are attributed to intersecting social positions and structural vulnerabilities. These uneven lived experiences shape – and are reshaped by – limited adaptive capacity, culturally inappropriate approaches, and insufficiently inclusive public spaces, thus complicating an equity-driven provision of refuge infrastructures. Results call for developing refuge infrastructures that address the intersecting social and climate needs of residents who need them the most.
- *Lesson learned*: it is important to understand whether climate shelters in Barcelona meet the needs of all residents, including the most marginalized people (in this case people living in the La Prosperitat neighborhood), so we can be sure that there is intersectional climate justice. There are intersecting vulnerabilities due to gender, class, migrant status, and other factors, which shape thermal (dis)comfort experiences and could be a reason for heat and cold inequalities. Always pay attention to these aspects to be sure not to exclude anyone. There should be attention to developing more equitable and inclusive adaptation strategies in order to avoid problems of distributive, procedural, and recognition justice. Every citizen should be aware of the existence of climate shelters, which should be present in all areas of the city.

- *Year*: 2023
- *Abstract*: The decarbonization and humanization of cities require actions to promote active mobility and improve public space. Strategic responses to socio-spatial inequality and urban environmental imbalance must be proposed. Proposals in Barcelona, such as the systematization of the so-called “superblocks” are already well recognized. However, there are other innovative studies and projects that introduce new approaches, methods, and instruments that promote neighborhood life and urban proximity: The “Civic axes for stitching neighborhoods” for Meridiana Ave; the “Network of neighborhood centralities” for the Poblenou-22@ school network; the “Urban strip to make neighborhoods” for Perú-Paraguay street, and the “Climate shelter school network strategy” for the microclimatic management of Barcelona. Studies that exemplify how the use of operational cartographic atlases and models that analyze reality, with parameters and indicators to identify urban patterns, are a useful tool for urban design.
- *Lesson learned*: In the past, public spaces were designed with the idea that they were only surfaces for the circulation of the private car; now it is important to promote more environmentally livable urban environments and streets, as well as  to establish policy and technical solutions that bring balance and spatial justice to the city. It is necessary to promote more livable and appropriate urban spaces for citizens, ensuring better accessibility, habitability, and centrality through an efficacious public space. For this reason, there are four projects in Barcelona: Civic axes to stitch the neighborhoods, Network of neighborhood centralities, Urban strip to make neighborhoods, Climate shelter school network strategy. By focusing on citizens and the environment in which they live it is possible to renew urban planning. In the project "Climate shelter school network strategy", open data is used to try to link schools, educational facilities, public space, sustainable mobility, and socio-environmental conditions in order to facilitate city knowledge and promote urban improvement projects. The project aims to improve the city of Barcelona (innovating from the existing): the city is a system composed of many parts working together. Schools are an important part of this system and connect with the streets, buildings, trees, water, and air. In this way, schools can help create a healthier and more pleasant environment for all citizens by promoting sustainable mobility, public green spaces, and active citizen participation. The project is part of the urban model being developed for Barcelona to respond to climate change and the Climate Plan


### ✅ Climate Shelters Network
https://www.barcelona.cat/barcelona-pel-clima/en/barcelona-responds/specific-actions/climate-shelters-network  
A climate shelter space has the following characteristics:
  - It can be indoors or outdoors.
  - The indoor spaces are activated all year round so they can be used to cope with both the heat and the cold.
  - The outdoor spaces are only active during the preventive phase for heatwaves, which is from 15 June to 15 September.
  - They are spaces that provide the population with thermal comfort, while at the same time maintaining other uses and functions.
  - In indoor spaces, it is recommended that a set temperature of 27ºC is maintained in the summer and 19ºC in the winter.
  - They are especially designed for people who are vulnerable to the heat and the cold (babies, those aged over 75 years and people with a chronic illness or those who are less well-off, etc.)
  - It is NOT for people that need medical care, who must go to the appropriate health centre.
  - They must be easily accessible and safe, and provide **comfortable rest areas** (chairs and benches) and **free water**.
  - The urban parks, which form part of this network, have **abundant urban greenery** (surface area > 0.5 ha) and an **NDVI index** (which indicates the quality of the vegetation) **> 0.4**, they are **accessible** to people with reduced mobility, and they have fountains and seats.
  - Areas designated as climate shelters are **free**.

### ❓Evaluating the impact of urban parks on the thermal comfort during a heat wave episode in a Mediterranean city
https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU23/EGU23-1367.html (only abstract available)
- *Authors*: Ricard Segura, Carme Estruch, Alba Badia, Sergi Ventura, E. Scott Krayenhoff, and Gara Villalba
- *Year*: 2023
- *Abstract*: The Mediterranean basin is expected to experience an increase in intensity and frequency of heat wave events. Additionally, heat peaks are exacerbated by the low albedo of urban materials and the heat island effect of urban areas. To reduce heat-related discomfort and health risks, urban planners aim to implement green infrastructures to regulate temperatures thanks to their transpiration cooling effect. For example, the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona (AMB) has created a metropolitan network of “climate shelters”, which are public spaces (both indoor and outdoor) where urban dwellers can find better climatic conditions. Urban parks can be considered “climate shelters” if two requirements are met: the NDVI of the vegetation is higher than 0.4 and the extension of the park is bigger than 0.5 ha. However, given the dense urban edification and space limitation, we wanted to explore the thermal regulation capacity of smaller urban parks which are easier to implement. In this study, we present the results of a micrometeorological measurement campaign to assess the temporal and spatial variations of thermal comfort in parks of different sizes in the AMB during a heatwave episode in July 2022. The goals of this study are to determine the impact on human biometeorology of urban design in the construction of urban parks for facing heatwave episodes and to check the classification requirements for the “climate shelters”. 
Using a mobile human-biometeorological weather station (MaRTy cart), we registered the microclimatic factors affecting thermal exposure at different points inside and outside the parks. From the microclimatic measurements we derived the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI). Additional characterization of the measurement points consisted in sky-view-factor estimations and 360o vegetation and impervious view factors. Throughout the campaign period and measurement hours (14:00, 15:00 and 20:00 LT), the UTCI varied between 29.5 oC (moderate heat stress) and 41.9 oC (very strong heat stress). During the early afternoon, when air temperatures and heat stress are higher, the UTCI is lower inside of the parks, by a difference that ranges from 1.0 oC to 3.2 oC. The sky-view-factor is responsible for 43 to 58% of the observed variability in the UTCI, pointing out the importance of tree shadowing inside the parks. Air temperature has also a clear influence on thermal comfort, explaining between 17 and 50% of the UTCI variability. Although air temperature reductions in smaller parks are not as significant as in the “climate shelter” park, there are vegetation zones inside the smaller parks with comparable reductions in the UTCI. The results show that small parks can provide thermal comfort in similar capacity as bigger parks classified as “climate shelters”.
- *Lesson learned*: requirements for climate shelters: NDVI > 0.4; extension of the park >  0.5 ha. Also small parks can provide thermal comfort in similar capacity as bigger parks classified as “climate shelters”.

### ✅ Urban heat resilience at the time of global warming: evaluating the impact of the urban parks on outdoor thermal comfort
- *Authors*: Farshid Aram, Ebrahim Solgi, Ester Higueras Garcia and Amir Mosavi
- *Year*: 2020
- *Abstract*: Background: In densely populated urban centers, increased air temperature due to urban heat island (UHI) effect can undermine the thermal comfort and health of citizens. Research has shown that large urban parks can mitigate the effect of UHIs and improve thermal comfort, especially in the warmer months of the year when temperature changes are more noticeable. This study investigated the cooling effect intensity (CEI) of the Retiro Park in the center of Madrid at three different distances from its southern edge and the impact of this cooling effect on thermal comfort from physiological and psychological perspectives. This investigation was performed by measuring microclimate data and conducting a survey simultaneously during the summer days.
Results: The results showed that the CEI of the park varies with distance from its edge. Because of this effect, air temperature within the 130 m and 280 m distance of the park was, respectively, 1.6 °C and 0.9 °C lower than the temperature at the 520 m distance (the nearest heat island). After examining the effect of the park in terms of physiological equivalent temperature (PET), it was found that the PET at the 130 m and 280 m distance of the park was 9.3% and 5.4% less than the PET in the heat island domain. More than 81% of the respondents (in all three areas) had a mental image of the park as the place where they would experience the highest level of outdoor thermal comfort, and this rate was higher in the areas closer to the park. The analysis of citizens’ responses about perceived thermal comfort (PTC) showed that citizens in areas with higher CEI had perceived a higher degree of thermal comfort from the psychological perspective.
Conclusion: This study demonstrates the significant role of large urban parks located in the core of the populated cities in providing thermal comfort for citizens from both physiological and psychological perspectives. Additionally, the results of this study demonstrated that among the environmental (natural and artificial) factors around the park (topography, urban structure, etc.), the aspect ratio has the greatest impact on thermal comfort.
- *Lesson learned*: large urban parks (>10 ha) generates a cooling effect that can reduce the temperature of their surrounding area, this effect  diminishes
at the distance of 520 m, which falls in the domain of a heat island. Hence, the cooling effect intensity (CEI) of the park is higher in the areas closer to the park. But the dimension is not the only relevant aspect, there are other natural and artificial factors around the park that have an important  role in park cooling effect, such as:
  - Urban configuration: organic urban structures can improve airflow and so reduce air temperatures
  - Topography: an urban area with a lower elevation is warmer, as a result, the distance of the cooling effect in the urban fabric is less than in areas with higher elevation.
  - Aspect ratio (ratio between the height and the width of the buildings and streets in the urban area): is an influential element on perceived thermal comfort

  Any increase or decrease in the CEI  will influence the level of thermal comfort of citizens who live or work near the park from both physiological and psychological perspectives. If you are within 520m of the park, you enjoy higher physiological thermal comfort. Parks are seen by people as places to find thermal comfort, in fact they generate thermal comfort for citizens from both physiological and psychological perspectives. If you are in the areas with higher CEI then your degree of thermal comfort from a psychological point of view will be higher



 ### ✅ Capacity of Urban Green Infrastructure Spaces to Ameliorate Heat Wave Impacts in Mediterranean Compact Cities: Case Study of Granada (South-Eastern Spain)
- *Authors*: Manuel José Delgado-Capel, Paloma Cariñanos, and Marcos Escudero-Viñolo
- *Year*: 2023
- *Abstract*: Heat wave episodes are becoming more frequent and severe worldwide, especially in areas such as the Mediterranean region. This study is aimed at assessing the impact of heat waves in an urban environment and the ways areas of urban green infrastructure (UGI) can play key roles in moderating the impacts of these high-temperature events. We analyzed land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data retrieved from Landsat 8/9 satellite images. These data were recorded during heat wave episodes from 2017 to 2022 in a representative Mediterranean medium-sized compact city. We carried out a correlation analysis between LST and
NDVI per area type and as individual units to assess how UGI elements can contribute to the cooling of the urban matrix during heat wave episodes. Those small green spaces distributed throughout the city, defined as “Other” areas, showed stronger negative correlation. These spaces are particularly relevant for Mediterranean cities, where highly limited space in city centers hinders the possibility of having larger-surface UGI elements. The study highlights the need for further research into the
composition of those small public green spaces to understand how their components enhance the city’s cooling capacity given the climate conditions and water scarcity in the Mediterranean region.
- *Lesson learned*: Four types of green areas are defined in this research: Core (large-sized patches), Node (medium-sized patches), Link ( linear spatial distributions which connect core and node areas with each other), Other (smaller public urban green spaces). Considering all areas, "Other" areas are very important as they are able to strengthen the cooling capacity of cities during heat waves, in fact this area type registers the lowest LST average values. Other areas have a strong cooling capacity against extreme temperatures during heat wave episodes. There is also a negative correlation between NDVI and LST data for the "Other" area type per episode. Hence, "Other" area type can help Mediterranean city during heat waves: for this reason, it is important to identify the composition of these small public green spaces and to  understand how their components contribute to the city´s cooling capacity enhancement

### ✅ Heat waves and adaptation strategies in a mediterranean urban context
- *Authors*: Giuseppe Maggiotto, Alessandro Miani, Emanuele Rizzo, Maria Domenica Castellone, Prisco Piscitelli
- *Year*: 2021
- *Abstract*: Background: Heat waves can be considered as an emerging challenge among the potential health risks generated by urbanization and climate changes. Heat waves are becoming more frequent, long and intense, and can be defined as meteorological extreme events consisting in prolonged time of extremely high temperatures in a
particular region. The following paper addresses health threats due to heat waves presenting the case study of Lecce, a city located in Southern Italy; the Mediterranean area is already recognized in international literature as a hot-spot for climate changes. This work assesses the potential impact of two different adaptation strategies.
Methods: We have tested the effectiveness of cool surfaces and urban forestry as adaptation approaches to cope with heat waves. The microclimate computer-based model “ENVI-met” was adopted to predict thermal scenarios arising from the two proposed interventions. The parameters analysed consisted in temperature and relative humidity. Results: Urban forestry approach seem to lower temperature (that represents the major cause of urban overheating) better than cool surfaces strategy, but relative humidity produced by the evapotranspiration processes of urban forestry has also negative influences on temperature perceived by pedestrians (thermal discomfort). Conclusion: Vegetation represents both an adaptation and a mitigation strategy to climate changes that guarantees an improvement of air quality, with consequent psychological and physical benefits. Wide campaigns aimed at planting trees and increasing the urban green coverage should be systematically planned and fostered by national, regional and local institutions preferably with the involvement of research departments, schools and citizens’ associations.
- *Lesson learned*: Cities can implement mitigation and adaptation strategies to cope with climate change. In the case of urban forestation, a significant decrease in temperature has been observed: shade (acting as a filter for solar radiation) and evapotranspiration (plants becoming a kind of “adsorbing sink” for atmospheric heat) cool the area. We should consider trees and green areas as real and proper public health infrastructures. Hence vegatation is very important because it represents a strategy for adaptation and mitigation to climate change that ensures improved air quality, leading to psychological, physical and social benefits.

### Nature-based approaches to managing climate change impacts in cities
- *Authors*: Sarah E. Hobbie and Nancy B. Grimm
- *Year*: 2020
- *Abstract*: Managing and adapting to climate change in urban areas will become increasingly important as urban populations grow, especially because unique features of cities amplify climate change impacts. High impervious cover exacerbates impacts of climate warming through urban heat island effects and of heavy rainfall by magnifying runoff and flooding. Concentration of human settlements along rivers and coastal zones increases exposure of people and infrastructure to climate change hazards, often
disproportionately affecting those who are least prepared. Nature-based strategies (NBS), which use living organisms, soils and sediments, and/or landscape features to reduce climate change hazards, hold promise as being more flexible, multi-functional and adaptable to an uncertain and non-stationary climate future than traditional approaches. Nevertheless, future research should address the effectiveness of NBS for reducing climate change impacts and whether they can be implemented at scales appropriate to climate change hazards and impacts. Further, there is a need for accurate and comprehensive cost–benefit analyses that consider disservices and
co-benefits, relative to grey alternatives, and how costs and benefits are distributed across different communities. NBS are most likely to be effective and fair when they match the scale of the challenge, are implemented with input from diverse voices and are appropriate to specific social, cultural, ecological and technological contexts.
